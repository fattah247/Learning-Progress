# README Learning-Progress #

Learning-Progress is a repository that holds materials I've learned related to swifts and UI creation. In this repository, there are several projects from several courses. Existing projects will start from the simple ones, gradually increasing in difficulty.

## What is this repository for? ##
* This repository shows my learning process.
* This repository shows what I've learned.
* This repository is my source when revising and learning concepts from scratch if needed.

## How to see the repository? ##
The projects have been numbered according to the order based on the development time. In general, projects made earlier have a lower level of difficulty.

## What to pay attention to? ##

Some of the projects are not private but available from the course, and I added some changes and comments. I will include the author's name and course source in each project. Please mind the project creator.
